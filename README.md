CashFlow Solution

This project is architected using clean architecture principles in .NET 9.0 with a modular design separating API, Application, Domain, Infrastructure, Communication, and Exception handling layers. It leverages MySQL as the database backend, with Docker support for easy setup and deployment. The codebase emphasizes maintainable and testable design, incorporating robust unit testing using xUnit alongside powerful tools such as AutoMapper for object mapping, FluentAssertions for expressive and readable tests, FluentValidation for comprehensive request data validation, and Scallar for functional programming paradigms or scripting integration. These technologies help ensure clean, reliable, and scalable application development.
